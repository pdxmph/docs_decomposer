    ### Overview
  
    The app thinks of our docs as **projects**, **versions**, and
    **pages**. **Projects** are things like Puppet Enterprise, Puppet,
    Hiera, and Facter. **Versions** are versions of those projects. Pages
    are individual pages of documentation.
  
    The only projects currently in this system are Puppet Enterprise and
    Puppet. The only versions of those two projects currently in this
    system are the 3.7 versions of each.
    
    ### Getting Started
  
    You can access the projects from the `Project` menu item at the top
    of the screen. That will open a page showing the versions available
    for the project. From there, you can select a version to work on by
    clicking on it.
  
    ### Using the Version Page
  
    The version page shows a table of all files in that version. If
    you're a technical writer (look for a star by your login name in the
    upper right corner), you can set the priority or risk for each
    page without having to open the page. 
  
    ### Using Individual Pages
    
    Individual pages have tools that allow you to:
  
    * Comment on the page
    * Add or remove tags from the page
    * Set the risk or priority of the page
   
    ### More Documentation
   
    More documentation is available on [the manual page](/docs).

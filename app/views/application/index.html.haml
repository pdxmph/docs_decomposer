    ### Overview
  
    The app thinks of our docs as **projects**, **versions**, and
    **pages**.

    * **Projects** are things like Puppet Enterprise, Puppet,
    Hiera, and Facter.

    * **Versions** are versions of those projects. Pages
    are individual pages of documentation. Versions can be **active**
    (currently under development, or the most current release) or
    **inactive** (not under development, not the most current release). 
    
    
    ### Getting Started
  
    You can access the projects from the `Project` menu item at the top
    of the screen. That will open a page showing the versions available
    for the project. From there, you can select a version to work on by
    clicking on it.
  
    ### Using the Version Page
  
    The version page shows a table of all files in that version. If
    you're a technical writer, you can set the priority or risk for
    each page without having to open the page.
  
    ### Using Individual Pages
    
    Individual pages have tools that allow you to:
  
    * Comment on the page
    * Add or remove tags from the page
    * Set the risk or priority of the page
   
    ### More Documentation
   
    More documentation is available on [the manual page](/docs).

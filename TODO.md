- Tags are overwritten by form (need to add, not overwrite) (Fixed)
- Comments are not editable
- Risk and tags for individual pages should be settable at the pages view
- Pages should be categorized at least broadly (look for repeating titles)
- "Pages you've flagged" should just use the standard pages table
